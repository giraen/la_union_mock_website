                  The City of San Fernando in the province of La Union was created in 1998 and is situated in the mountainous area along the China Sea. It was founded in 1786 and became the provincial capital in 1850. During the Spanish era, the area faced challenges from pirates and headhunters, prompting the residents to come together and establish the settlement of San Fernando. The settlement was named after the Catholic King of Spain, with San Guillermo as the patron saint.
                  <br><br>
                  Over the years, San Fernando experienced slow growth due to limited travel and sectionalism. However, the people made progress economically, educationally, and spiritually, leading to uprisings against the Spanish rule. In 1898, the Filipino insurgents successfully attacked the Spanish garrison in San Fernando.
                  <br><br>
                  With the arrival of the Americans, San Fernando transitioned to a democratic form of government and benefited from their teachings in politics and economics. The town suffered during World War II with bombings by the Japanese and subsequent battles with guerrilla forces. Despite the destruction, San Fernando eventually rose as the administrative capital of Region I.
                  <br><br>
                  In 1998, San Fernando achieved its dream of becoming a city through Republic Act 8509. It is now a center for national government agencies, trade, commerce, finance, and education. The city boasts the La Union Botanical Garden, known for its diverse plant species and wildlife.
                  <br><br>
                  Overall, San Fernando has transformed into a thriving metropolis in the north, with a rich cultural heritage, industry, spirituality, and aspirations for growth, peace, and prosperity.</p>

                <p>
                  Agoo was founded in 1578 by Juan de Salcedo and was one of the twelve original towns of La Union. Two Franciscan missionaries, Fray Juan Bautista Lucarelli and Fray Sebastian de Baeza, arrived to start evangelism. The town's introduction to Christianity was signaled by the establishment of a nipa and bamboo church in honor of St. Francis of Assisi.
                  <br><br>
                  The two made Agoo their headquarters and center of the campaign to gather recruits in the surrounding areas. It was named after the river along its banks, which was a forest of pine-like trees. It also became the center of pacification and conquest of mountain tribes in the Cordilleras.
                  <br><br>
                  The Augustinians had to withdraw due to a conflict between their superiors and the governor-general in Manila, leading to a full discharge of pastoral ministry in Agoo.
                  <br><br>
                  The Augustinians established a primary school to teach Christianity and Catholicism, as well as the art of making bricks, lime, brick-laying, stone-quarrying, and Moro-moro and Pasyon.
                  <br><br>
                  The construction of a church was led by Fr. Satornino Franco and a three-layered belfry was made by Fr. Casiniro Melgosa and Fr. Aguiliano Garcia. By the end of the 15th century, the image of Nuestra Seora de Caridad was installed.
                  <br><br>
                  Agoo had its share of tribulations during the Japanese occupation, including burning part of Macalva and massacred 17 civilians. After the liberation of the country, Constantino Verceles became the first elected mayor and Manuel Cases sponsored the Masalip Irrigation System.
                  <br><br>
                  Jose D. Aspiras was an illustrious son of the town, elected to the Philippine Congress in 1929 and served as Minister of Tourism and Information Secretary. He was also the resident representative and managing director of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taiwan.
                  <br><br>
                  Aspiras led the restoration and refurbishment of the 16th Century Agoo Parish Church, which was later elevated to Basilica Minore status by Pope John Paul II in 1981.</p>

                  Aringay, initially part of Pangasinan, became a municipality in 1741 under the jurisdiction of Pangasinan and Nueva Segovia. It later became part of La Union when the province was established in 1850. In 1903, Aringay and Caba were merged into one municipality but separated in 1907. The early settlers were fishermen from Ilocos Sur and Ilocos Norte, who settled near the mouth of Aringay River. The town's name is believed to have originated from a legend about two lovers. Aringay is known for its aquaculture and agricultural activities, including milkfish, prawn, and oyster culture, as well as rice and vegetable cultivation. One of its historical landmarks is a tunnel used as a refuge during the American regime, which is being considered for restoration as part of the proposed Aringay-Baguio Road.

                  The town of Bacnotan was founded in 1599 as part of Ilocos Sur and became part of Pangasinan in 1785. When La Union was created in 1850, Bacnotan was one of the original twelve towns that made up the province. In the past, Bacnotan was ruled by a despotic chieftain who had absolute control over all his constituents. Disobedience to his directives meant severe flogging for the culprit. During the Spanish period, the name of the town was changed from “Bakunutan” to “Bacnotan”.
                  <br><br>
                  The town’s history is linked with the deeds of the heroic men who fought, bled and died for their own native land. At the turn of the century, during the Spanish – American War, Dumarang (now Quirino) was a scene of the carnage and plunder. In December 1941, the first organized resistance against the Japanese invaders was at Barrios Baroro and Bacsil. The young soldiers, mostly in their twenties, valiantly defended the Baroro Bridge.
                  <br><br>
                  After the war in 1945, Bacnotan became the provisional seat of the provincial government, leading to the transfer of the La Union High School and the establishment of the North Provincial High School. In 1949, the mineral deposits for cement production were discovered in Barrio Dumarang, leading to the establishment of Cebu Portland Cement (CEPOC). In 1960, the La Union Agricultural School was established, which was later named Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (DMMMSU). In 1965, an attempt was made to create a municipality out of the town of Bacnotan, but President Diosdado Macapagal acted favorably to the proposal by issuing an executive order on November 29, 1965 which provided that the new municipality be created upon the appointment of a mayor, vice-mayor and councilors. However, no municipal council was appointed and no new municipality was created.

                  Bagulin is located in the eastern part of La Union and is known for its broom-making industry due to the abundance of tiger grass. The name "Bagulin" originated from the story of a young highlander named Bago and a lowlander girl named Ulin, who fell in love and settled in the area, naming it after their son Bagulin. In 1903, Bagulin became a regular municipality of Mountain Province and later came under the jurisdiction of La Union. In 1963, Bagulin was officially converted into a regular municipality. The town is characterized by its hilly and mountainous terrain, with various natural features such as the Bagulin River, Loslosi Falls, and Cardiz Spring, which have potential for tourist development. Additionally, Bagulin is known for the cultural treasure of Allabok, where burial caves and hanging coffins can be found.

                  Balaoan, an ancient municipality in La Union, was founded in 1704. It derived its name from a miscommunication during the Spanish era. The town witnessed corruption and abuse, leading to the establishment of the Insurectos secret society. Seven martyrs, known as the Siete Martires, were executed for their revolutionary activities. The revolution against Spain eventually succeeded, and the town experienced subsequent governance under the Philippine Republic and the American civil government. Despite encountering challenges, peace and order were restored in Balaoan. Notable figures from the municipality include Dr. Camilo Osias and Magnolia Antonino.

                  The town of Bangar derived its name from the bangar tree, which was abundant in the area during the Spanish regime. The tree had various uses, such as prized boards for house interiors and dye for handwoven products. The old town of Bangar consisted of three smaller towns, and nearby were communities of the indigenous "Igorotes Infieles." The Amburayan River provided a source of income through gold panning, while the hills and mountains supplied timber. Bangar was officially founded in 1700 and became part of La Union in 1850. During World War II, the town experienced the impact of the conflict, with residents seeking refuge in barrios and joining underground movements. Bangar is known for its loom-weaving industry and agriculture, primarily rice and tobacco cultivation. Fishing also plays a significant role in the coastal barangays, with abundant catches of different fish varieties in the Amburayan River and coastal waters.

                  Bauang was established in 1590 and officially recognized as a town in 1765 with Don Francisco delos Reyes as its first gobernadorcillo. When La Union was created in 1850, Bauang was one of the twelve towns that formed the province. Moro pirates invaded Bauang without warning, killing people, kidnapping women and children, stealing cattle, looting the town, and breaking into the church. They stole silver and gold, and robbed the church of its silver and gold.
                  <br><br>
                  The construction of watchtowers, locally known as baluarte, along the coast and at the mouth of the Bauang River was a response to the invasions of pirates. These watchtowers served as a fortress against the invading pirates and as a refuge for the inhabitants. However, nothing remains of the watchtower except the traces of its foundation. The people's heroism, dedication, love and commitment to the ideals of freedom in the 1900s were passed down from generation to generation. During the late 1890s, Bauang residents succeeded in wrestling the town from the tyrannical administration of the Spaniards after fierce and bloody encounters between the “cazadores” (Spanish soldiers) and the “revolucionaros” (Filipinos). The revolucionaros were led separately by Remigio Patacsil and Mauro Ortiz.
                  <br><br>
                  In 1913, some barrios of Bauang were assigned to San Fernando. During the Japanese occupation, many unknown and unsung sons of Baunag fought gallantly and spilled their blood in defense of freedom. Most of the youth joined the underground movement and enlisted in the various regiments of the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines, Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL). Manuel Arguilla and Major Alberto O. Fenit were executed by the Japanese at the dungeons of Fort Santiago.
                  <br><br>
                  The martyrdom and patriotism of Mayor Ambrosio Rimando, elected mayor of Bauang before the outbreak of the war, can be told and retold. He chose not to reveal the whereabouts of his townspeople who were executed in his presence before he himself was beheaded. Many continued the fight with gallantry and valor until the country was liberated from the Japanese oppressors. In the early 70’s, Bauang earned the appellation as the “Beach Capital of the Philippines” due to the calm waters, fine sand and languidly swaying coconut trees along the shorelines of Baccuit Sur to Pagdalagan Sur. A newly discovered “Research Reef” is a favorite dive spot among local and foreign scuba divers. Bauang is also famous for its delicious grapes and guapples grown in barangays Payocpoc, Santiago, Bagbag and Urayong.

                  Burgos, the easternmost town of La Union, was named after Father Jose Burgos, a martyr who stopped at barrio Agpay while fleeing from the Spaniards. Originally part of Barrio Disdis in Sablan, Benguet, the area was known as "Baresbes" due to its numerous creeks and rivers, which created swamps and made it a natural habitat for inland fishes. The early settlers were Ibalois and Kankanaeys from Benguet, joined by Ilocanos from various places. The geographical profile of La Union changed in 1903, and the Disdis Municipal District was created. It was later annexed to Sablan, Benguet, but in 1920, it was reverted to La Union. In 1925, the Municipal District of Burgos was established with several barrios. The seat of government moved to Central in the 1930s and eventually to New Poblacion in 1960 when Burgos became a regular municipality. The town is known for its production of tigergrass, pineapples, bananas, and other fruits. The Libtong Lake, a local attraction, is a 1-hectare lake with abundant freshwater fish and remains unaffected by seasonal changes.

                  The town of Luna, formerly known as Namacpacan, was founded in 1690 along the national road from Vigan to Manila. It gained prominence due to its hospitality, offering food and shelter to travelers. The town became known for the miracles attributed to Our Lady of Namacpacan, a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1871, the statue was brought to the town and remained there after being unable to continue its journey. The town's name was changed to Luna in 1906 in honor of the Luna brothers, Antonio and Juan. During World War II, Luna played a significant role as the headquarters for the USAFIP-NL and the landing site for supplies. Presently, agriculture, fishing, and stone-picking industry are the main occupations in Luna. The town is also renowned for its Ilocano delicacies and clay products.

                  Caba, a municipality in the Philippines, has had three names interchangeably used throughout its history: Caba, Cava, and Caua. The origin of its name is subject to two different tales. According to one story, a Spaniard asked a local inhabitant the name of the place, and the youth misunderstood, responding with the name of the animal he was herding, "Cava." The repeated use of the name eventually led to "Cava" and later "Caba." Another story suggests that a group of immigrants from barrio Caba in San Carlos, Pangasinan settled in the area in the late 16th century and named the new settlement Caba in memory of their place of origin.
                  <br><br>
                  Caba was founded as a settlement in 1598 by Augustinian Fathers, with Don Agustin dela Cruz as the first leader. It became a barangay in 1692, with Don Luis Manongdo as the cabeza de barangay, and officially became a town in 1783, with Don Domingo Aragon as the gobernadorcillo. Different historians have proposed conflicting dates for the town's founding, with some claiming 1745 and others asserting 1844.
                  <br><br>
                  In 1903, the Philippine Commission reorganized the municipalities in the country, leading to the integration of smaller municipalities due to population or financial challenges. Caba was initially integrated with Aringay, but in 1907, Executive Order No. 41 was issued to separate Caba from Aringay, making it a regular municipality once again. Diego Silang, a national hero and leader of the Ilocos Revolt of 1762-1763, was born in Caba. He established an independent rebel government in Northern Luzon and fought for reforms before being assassinated. His wife, Gabriela, continued the rebellion after his death but was eventually captured and executed.
                  <br><br>
                  The town of Caba carries historical significance as the birthplace of Diego Silang and the site of his rebellion against Spanish rule.

                  Naguilian, a municipality in the Philippines, derives its name from the Iloko word "Nag-ili-a," which means the place where people from other places come to stay. The name "Naguilian" evolved from the original "Nag-ili-a." The municipality covers an area of 8,740 hectares and is bordered by the City of San Fernando to the northwest, Bagulin to the northeast, Bauang to the west, Aringay to the south, Caba to the southwest, Sablan (Benguet) to the southeast, and Burgos to the east.
                  <br><br>
                  The development of Naguilian can be traced back to a barangay of immigrants who settled along the shore of La Union due to increasing population density. Over time, these families migrated to new territories and discovered the fertile valley of Naguilian, which was still part of Bauang. They established a colony at the fork of two rivers and began developing the area.
                  <br><br>
                  The construction of the Catholic Church in Naguilian took place in 1739 when the Spaniards established their authority in the region. The centennial celebration of the Catholic Church in 1839 marked the separation of Naguilian from the town of Bauang. When La Union became a province in 1850, Naguilian was one of the twelve towns that constituted the province.
                  <br><br>
                  The town's built-up areas are generally clustered linearly along the barangay roads, while agricultural lands are located in the valleys, where crops such as rice, corn, tobacco, sugarcane, and other agricultural products are cultivated. Forest areas cover a significant portion of the municipality's land. Barangay Casilagan has been declared a potential watershed area by the Bureau of Forestry.
                  <br><br>
                  Naguilian is renowned for being the home of the original Basi, a traditional sugarcane wine. The tradition of Basi making in the region dates back to the era of World War II. With the support of the local government, this industry has been revived and has become one of the main sources of income for the province. In addition to Basi, Naguilian is known for its thriving woodcraft industry in barangays Cabaritan Norte and Sur, Dallipaoen, and Al-alinao Norte. Barangays Bancagan and Daramuangan are known for their bamboocraft industry.

                  Pugo was organized as a town on January 1, 1912 from the sub-province of Benguet, Mountain Province in accordance with Executive Order No.77. It consisted of eight barrios with barrio Pugo as the seat of government. In 1919, it became a municipal district in the sub-province of Benguet. In 1947, it became regular municipalities of the Province of La Union, in accordance with Executive Order No. 72 issued by President Manuel A. Roxas.
                  <br><br>
                  The eight original barrios were settled by emigrants from the eastern part of Ilocos Sur about fifty years before the end of the Spanish regime. Barangay Cares, Poblacion East, Poblacion West and Tavora East were then part of Rancheria Tulosa, which was a hunting ground for hunters and bird trappers from Agoo. According to folktales, a high-ranking Spanish official saw swarms of quails and asked his guide the name POGO.

                  Rosario used to be a sitio and then a barrio of Santo Tomas, La Union, but was converted into a municipality in 1869. The earliest people of Rosario were immigrants from Sto. Tomas, La Union and Magsingal, followed by more immigrants from Agoo, Tubao, Aringay, San Fernando and Bacnotan. Don Mariano Posadas, Don Mariano Narcelles and Don Gavino Ordoa petitioned with the national and provincial authorities for barrio Rosario to become a regular municipality.
                  <br><br>
                  In 1869, the Spanish Provincial Governor appointed Don Agustin Isidro de Guzman as its first Captain Municipal. There are two stories on how Rosario got its name. In the early days, there were dense forests with wild animals and birds, and the rivers and brooks were deep and full of fishes. The banks of the Malitnaw and Nilanguyan rivers and the numerous brooks were covered with different kinds of ferns and wild roses. The Spanish soldiers who came to the place admired the beautiful landscape and the inhabitants found it easier and more convenient to join the words thus, the name "ROSARIO".
                  <br><br>
                  Rosario is the last town on the southern portion of La Union and is the first town in the Ilocos region. It is known as the "Gateway to Ilocandia" as it cuts through a mountain at barrio Agat, Sison, Pangasinan before it gently glides into the Bue bridge that marks the boundary between La Union and Pangasinan. Visitors will have a memorable impression of a typical Ilocos topography of hilly, narrow plains and valleys, shallow rivers and brooks.

                  San Gabriel, located in the eastern part of La Union province, was originally known as Sitio "Baka-Burnotan," named after a game played by the locals. Over time, the name was shortened to Burnotan. The area became an ideal settlement due to its fertile soil and wide plain along the river. In 1897, the Roman Catholic Church introduced Christianity to the pagan settlers and established a church, with Saint Gabriel as the patron saint. In honor of their patron saint, the place was renamed San Gabriel. It became a township in 1906 and later a municipality in 1922. In 1947, it was converted into a regular municipality. The introduction of Sagrada Familia, a subsidiary of the Aglipayan Church, attracted settlers from different provinces, particularly from the Cordillera region. The people of San Gabriel primarily engaged in highland farming, producing crops such as rice, corn, sweet potatoes, and root crops. To combat soil erosion, they constructed rice terraces and irrigation systems, leading to increased productivity. Additionally, the town is known for the abundant production of tiger grass and bananas.

                  According to Dr. Adriel Obar Meimban's book, "La Union, The Making of a Province," there are conflicting opinions among friar chroniclers regarding the exact date of San Juan's foundation. Julian Martin claimed it was founded in 1806, Salvador Fron recorded 1803, while Elviro Perez claimed it was established in 1585.
                  <br><br>
                Regardless of the exact date, San Juan was already a town when La Union province was created in 1850 and was one of its original twelve municipalities.
                <br><br>
                Originally called Baratao or Baltao, the town of San Juan was formally accepted as a Ministerio de Baratao. It was composed of a federation of settlements, including Bauang, Mapatnag, Allangigan, Dayawan, San Miguel de Bacnotan, San Juan Bautista de Baltao, San Guillermo de Dalangdang, San Vicente de Balanac, and a settlement named Bona or Boa. The center of the Ministerio was San Juan Bautista de Baltao, which is now San Juan.
                <br><br>
                In 1587, Baratao became the center of an encomienda under Captain Bernardo Sandi. Father Agustin Niño arrived and transferred the Ministerio to Bauang. This transfer made San Juan an alternative visita, a settlement without a parish priest, of Bauang and Bacnotan. It wasn't until 1807 that a permanent parish priest was assigned to San Juan.
                <br><br>
                During the revolution of 1896, the entire town of San Juan was destroyed. After the Spanish-American War, a Filipino priest took charge of the parish. Reverend Mariano Gaerlan, a native of San Juan, supervised the reconstruction of the church that had been burned during the revolution. His successor, Reverend Eustaquio Ocampo, completed the construction of the church. San Juan temporarily ceased to be a parish, and the spiritual needs of the people were overseen by the parish priest of San Fernando. However, in 1918, San Juan once again became a parish.
                <br><br>
                Jose delos Angeles became the first Captain Municipal of San Juan in 1782. During World War II, the entire town was devastated, causing significant disruption to its economy. After the war, San Juan underwent a process of rehabilitation.
                <br><br>
                Presently, San Juan covers an area of 5,186 hectares and has a four-kilometer shoreline facing the China Sea. It is famous for its surfing area along the beaches of Urbiztondo, which offers waves suitable for beginner and intermediate surfers. Consequently, San Juan has become a major tourist attraction in La Union province and contributes significantly to its tourism industry.
                <br><br>
                In addition to the surfing industry, San Juan is renowned for its pottery-making industry, producing clay products made from the indigenous dalikan clay hearth.
                <br><br>
                Agriculture remains the primary source of livelihood for the people of San Juan. The town has 1,765 hectares of rice fields, 722 hectares of tobacco and corn cultivation, and the remaining agricultural areas are used for growing vegetables and root crops.

                  Santol, a Balaoan northeastern Rancheria, became a township in 1908 under the sub-province Amburayan, Mountain Province. In 1920, a new province was planned to showcase socio-cultural integration amongst lowlanders, mountaineers and Bagos. However, protest resolutions were filed by the leaders of these municipalities against inclusion due to historical, economic, cultural and geographical reasons.
                  <br><br>
                  In 1922, Mountain Province relinquished Santol which became a municipal district of La Union. In 1949, Santol was elevated into a regular municipality status by Executive Order No. 214 issued by President Elpidio Quirino. Evidence of this is that Barrio Mangan was set aside as the place of the military emergency hospital and the center of distribution of food supplies for army personnel. Barrio Banbanaba was the site of a message center which was directly in touch with all the barrios of Balaoan, Santol, San Gabriel and Sudipen. Santol Central and Cadanglaan served as the grounds for training volunteers during the days nearing the landing of the Liberation Forces while Sammauting was the hiding place for the guerillas.
                  <br><br>
                  The name Santol is derived from two accounts: the first, which states that the place was once a favorite hunting ground for people interested in sculpture of religious images, and the second, which states that during the Spanish occupation, soldiers passed by the area, but the women did not understand Spanish and presumed the soldiers were asking for the name of the fruits they were carrying. One of the women answered “Santol, Apo”, and the soldiers also did not understand the dialect and all they remembered was the word Santol, hence the name of the place.

                  Santo Tomas was established in 1764 and named after its patron saint, Santo Tomas de Aquinas. It gained independence from Mangaldan, Pangasinan in the same year. After being briefly merged with Agoo, Santo Tomas regained its independence in 1785 under the leadership of Don Domingo Carpio. The town saw growth and development under Carpio's administration. The title of the town head changed from "gobernadorcillo" to "Captain" in 1843 and later to "Municipal Presidente" during the American regime. During World War II, Santo Tomas was occupied by Japanese soldiers until the American forces liberated the area in 1945. After the war, Don Eusebio Tabora became the first post-liberation municipal mayor. The town is known for its two mountains, Mount Carmen and Mount Kimmallogong, as well as its rivers, shorelines, and lakes, which provide fishing opportunities. Fishing is a major occupation in the coastal barangays, and Santo Tomas is renowned for its dried and smoked fish products, particularly in Barangay Damortis.

                  Sudipen, the northernmost town of the Province of La Union, is separated from the Province of Ilocos Sur by the Amburayan River.
                  <br><br>
                  According to a story from the Spanish period, the town got its name when a group of Spanish soldiers arrived in barrio Nagpanaoan, now called Old Central. They encountered elderly individuals who were repairing the roof of the barrio hall. One of the soldiers asked for the name of the place. Since the elderly folks did not know Spanish and thought the soldiers wanted to know what they were doing, the eldest among them answered, "suksukdipan mi toy abong apo," which means "we are patching the roof, sir." The soldiers recorded the word "Sukdipan," which eventually transformed into Sudipen during the American regime, becoming the town's name.
                  <br><br>
                  Initially, Sudipen was a barrio of Bangar, La Union. In 1906, Bartolome Laoagan Apusen, a respected community leader from Pias, Salcedo, Ilocos Sur, successfully organized Sudipen into a township of the sub-province of Lepanto, Amburayan. Ten years later, in 1916, the township became a municipal district of the Province of La Union. Finally, on August 17, 1947, Sudipen was reclassified as a regular sixth-class municipality of the Province of La Union. Today, Sudipen has been elevated to a fifth-class municipality.
                  <br><br>
                  The early settlers of Sudipen belonged to cultural minorities from the Mountain Province. Remnants of these groups, mainly the Kankaney and Bago tribes, can still be found in mountain barangays. However, due to intermarriage between highlanders and lowlanders, the tribes have spread throughout the municipality. As a result, the younger generations can no longer speak the dialects of the cultural minority.
                  <br><br>
                  Sudipen is traversed by two principal rivers. The Amburayan River stretches along its northern and eastern border, while the Lalonga or Chico River cuts through barangays Bigbiga, Bulalaan, and Maliclico. Both rivers provide water resources for agricultural and domestic purposes in Sudipen and the neighboring towns of Bangar, Luna, and Balaoan. The Mini Hydro Power Plant located in Barangay Turod harnesses water from these rivers for generating electricity.

                  Tubao, a town in La Union, was established in the mid-1880s after a petition from several barrios of Agoo and Aringay. It was officially created on July 20, 1885, and recognized as the 14th town by Governor Francia. The town was named after a misinterpretation of the word "TUAO," which was heard as "TUBAO" when Spaniards distributed religious manuscripts to the natives. Tubao served as a refuge for evacuees during World War II and became a base for guerrillas fighting against the Japanese forces. Notably, the Japanese established a garrison next to the Roman Catholic Church, and the residence of former Mayor Antonio Verceles became the staff house for Japanese officers.
